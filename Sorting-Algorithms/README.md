# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort works by iterating first element to last element, comparing two adjacent elements and swapping them if they are not in correct order. Each iteration places next larger value to its correct place.

Time Complexity:

Best case: O(n)

Average case: O(n^2)

Worst case: O(n^2)

Example:

First Pass:
( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.

( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4

( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2

( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.

Second Pass:
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 )

( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed. The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.

Third Pass:
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )


## Insertion Sort

Insertion sort works by comparing values at index with all its prior elements.We place value at the index where there are no lesser value to the elements. So when you reach last element,we get a sorted array.

## Selection Sort

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
